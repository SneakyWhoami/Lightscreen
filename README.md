A screenshot tool.
This fork repairs Linux support and uploader-url-to-clipboard.
It does so in a hacky and cheeky way.
You need at least Qt 5.7 to compile.
Be sure to check out using `git clone --recursive` as there are two submodules needed.

Original repository doesn't accept issues.
C++ is not my strongest language.

This tool is pretty cool!

`qmake`, `make`, and then just put the binary into your path somewhere or whatever you like. There is no `install` recipe. You WILL get errors in compilation unless you have a [Recent version of Qt](https://www.qt.io/download/)
